5/24 Notes and thoughts (very scattered)

	-We need to make interfaces:
		-Database, spotify (exists mostly, we can maybe make our own that uses it?), general app interfaces
		-I want to easily be able to interact with the database for testing and the likes, so we should
		 also maybe add a testing suite of sorts for the database

	-Need to decide on whether or not we need our own profile management,
	 if so how to go about that; or whether spotify on its own is enough





-Features:
	-Add Log-Out button / disconnect from spotify button; see another app that ties together spotify for example
	-If we are using our own account management system, adding similar management

-To research:
	-Interface design with android apps, how to do it in a good clean manner, whether or not that is good design practice or not
	 in android


MODEL objects:

	To be created and changed for each "station" you are listening to
	-Now Playing (DJ, Track, current location in track, playlist, etc)
	-DJ
	-User
	-Track
	-Playlist (current)
