 * Created by John Osberg on 5/26/2015.
 * This interface should be used to fetch the DJs for a given listener.
 * It will interface with the Database and provide the caller lists of DJs, and upon entering a station, the relevant track info.
 * This should be the primary class used to get and store information for the listener.
